Explanation of each file:

- chronos_tab_trial1.py : File to run timer app
- messagebox_diy.py : File to run the options when the timer ends
- convert.py: file to compile messagebox_diy.py to .exe that is runnable depending on the OS 
- extension_setting.py : The file to show the main menu in the settings
- set_color_hue_timer.py : The file to set the color hue timer 

Each file attempts to try to code the Figma version of the extension browswer. It is unfinished and potentially will be improved in the future.
