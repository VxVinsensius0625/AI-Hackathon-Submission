We designed a browser extension for tab management.
Problem: Existing tab management apps donâ€™t address the root issue of FOMO. Closing a tab is losing out on an opportunity.
Solution: Timed color cues and prompting, and an ability to link your tabs by group help reduce the tabs you keep open without losing the relevant stuff. 

Demoed in Figma and Python.
